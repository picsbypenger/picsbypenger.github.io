<div class="title">SHUTTER SPEED</div>
<p>Shutter speed is the amount of time light is allowed to contact the sensor or film represented in fractions or whole seconds. Slower shutter speeds enable brighter images and motion blur and are often used in night photography, panning photos, and shutter drags. Fast shutter speeds freeze motion but cut out light. They are often used in sports and animal photography.</p>

<div class="title">APERTURE</div>
<p>Aperture is the size of the lens opening represented by the f-stop number. The lower the f-stop, the larger the lens opening. Larger lens openings allow more light to enter the camera and induce shallow depth of field, creating more depth of field blur. The higher the f-stop, the smaller the lens opening. Smaller lens openings cut limit light but broaden the depth of field. </p>

<div class="title">ISO</div>
<p>ISO is the sensitivity for a digital sensor or certain roll of film. The higher the ISO, the more sensitive the camera will be towards light. Higher ISO allows for shooting in darker scenarios, but adds noise to the photograph. Film ISO can be adjusted in the darkroom by changing the time or temperature of the developer. </p>
