<p>Christoffer Relander is a Finnish photographer who loves both what's real and surreal; his alternative and experimental techniques, primarily with in-camera multiple exposures, bridges the gap between them. His work is stunning. His artistic vision is ambitious and his execution of such difficult techniques is unbelievable.</p>

<p>Marcin Ryczek is a Polish photographer. He follows the principle of "minimum form, maximum content" in his work. His use of contrast, geometry, and balance add an abstract twist to his compositions. He combines small aperture and meticulous perspectives to flatten depth and shroud reality. Devoid of color, his black and white photos are further removed from context, compelling his audience to take a closer look.</p>

<p>Brandon Woelfel is a photographer based in New York. He is extremely talented at editing his photographs. With Photoshop, he is able to control the colors and light of his images to create the atmosphere he desires. As a primarily digital photographer, I aspire to be as adept as he is at editing photographs.</p>
